# BSTCheck

## Problem Statement:

Given a binary tree, check whether it's a binary search tree or not.

A Binary Search Tree (BST) has the property that all nodes on the left are smaller than the root and all nodes on the right are larger. We will need to check that for ALL subtrees, not just the immediate children.
